<h2>How to Contribute</h2>
<p>This game is admittedly rudimentary, and I am publishing here to attract other amateur developers. If you play through <em>Azulore</em> and find ways it could be improved (i.e, accessibility, layout, additional branches/endings), feel free to make a new branch and expand the world! </p>
